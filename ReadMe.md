# Node.js file

## Note:

1. we don't have window objects in Node.js.
2. we have global objects

## global objects in js

1.  console.log();
2.  setTimeout();
3.  clearTimeout();
4.  setInterval();

## variable

### in below values and functions are define but globally it's not define

### ex:

##### var message=''

##### console.log(global.message)

In this example, a variable is declared using the var keyword, but it does not add global objects. Its scope is limited to the page only
